# Rules

There are rule queries that can be examples for how to build custom rules

Here are some of the SQL Statemens I use for custom rules to automate some of the functionality

### AutoRoute
 This query is for a custom KACE Rule to auto-balance tickets between technicians. I can't believe this isn't a feature in KACE but here is a rule to do it

### AutoCategory
This is an example rule to AutoCategorize a Ticket

### ReassignTicket
This is an example rule to move a ticket

### UpdateTitle
This query is for a custom KACE Rule to discover if a Ticket is missing it's title and update it with the first 30 characters of the Summary
